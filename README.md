# Laptop-Price-Prediction-using-ML
Laptops are portable computer that encompasses a microprocessor, rechargeable battery, fold-down screen, keyboard and mouse.

As laptops are really compact and easy to carry anywhere it makes them a preferred choice over any other gadget.

In this project we are going to apply various Machine Learning Algorithms to accurately predict the price of laptops based on several
features.

This project predicts laptop price training and implements machine learning models such as:

-Linear Regression

-Ridge Lasso Regression

-Decision Trees

-Random Forest Algorithms.
